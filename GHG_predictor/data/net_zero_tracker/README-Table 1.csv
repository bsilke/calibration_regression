Thanks for downloading the Net Zero Tracker's data.;;;;
;;;;
This database is updated on a rolling basis by a dedicated team of volunteers. A refreshed version of this file is uploaded every four hours to ensure the most current data is available. If you have any queries, or think that one of the entities is out of date, please email updates@zerotracker.net.;;;;

Who do we track?;;;;
;;;;
"We track net zero and similar commitments of (i) all UNFCCC member states; (ii) regions in the top 25-emitting countries (iii) cities with a population of over 500,000 inhabitants; (iv) the world's largest 2,000 publicly-traded companies (currently based on the Forbes 2000 list [ https://www.forbes.com/lists/global2000 ]); and (v) the world's largest 100 private companies. Although this list is not inclusive of all entities with net zero targets, it captures the majority of the world's biggest emitters.";;;;
;;;;
What do we track?;;;;
;;;;
We track net zero commitments across a range of indicators.;;;;
;;;;
Many entities use a range of terms that are similar to net zero interchangeably. As such, our team considers the following to be within scope:;;;;
;;;;
"Net zero; zero emissions; zero carbon; climate neutral; climate positive; carbon neutral(ity); greenhouse gas neutral(ity); carbon negative; net negative; 1.5°C target; and science-based target.";;;;
;;;;
"While there are differences between the terms (see an explanation of those here [ https://netzeroclimate.org/what-is-net-zero ]), the Tracker aims to capture the essence of the target even where the target name might not be officially termed ""net zero"". In line with this, our net zero numbers dashboard on the home page includes targets with all of the aforementioned terms.";;;;
;;;;
The data on net zero commitments is collected from publicly-available data, such as international commitments, laws, governmental policies, entities' websites, corporate annual reports, sustainability reports and press releases.;;;;
;;;;
From these types of documents, the robustness of a target is assessed across a range of indicators. Broadly, this encompasses the status of the target, what is covered by the target, governance mechanisms and the role of offsets in the target. More detail about each indicator is available in the Tracker Codebook [ https://docs.google.com/document/d/13bGE8FCOeF5QweoOvyMPZi3XbZrGLEPL2aM04LuZQcc/edit?usp=sharing ];;;;
;;;;
The indicators are used to understand the prevalence of net zero targets, as well as their robustness, but does not at present track implementation.;;;;
