# Predicting Corporate Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions via Regression

## Overview

A regression model will be developed to predict the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (a continuous numerical value in CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents) for publicly listed corporations. To this end, the latest available data snapshot from the Net Zero Tracker will be used. In addition to GHG emissions, the dataset contains information on features such as industry sector, revenue, number of employees, region, and existing ESG scores. 

The project directly addresses the significant real-world problem of the large data gap in corporate emissions reporting. By training the model on known data, the emissions of companies for which data is currently missing or unreported can be estimated. 

The resulting insights will provide policymakers, ESG investors, consultants, and the public with crucial information. This information is intended to rapidly identify reporting gaps, target interventions efficiently, and improve the design of effective policies that drive global corporate accountability and climate action.

## Data Scope

The Net Zero Tracker collects information on targets for net zero emissions (and similar aims) pledged by countries, states/regions/provinces (hereafter 'regions' for short), cities, and companies.

It records net zero targets or the absence of such a target for:

- All of the 2,000 largest publicly-listed companies, as detailed in the Forbes Global 2000 list

- The world's 100 largest privately-owned companies.
